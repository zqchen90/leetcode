# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal 

## Question
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [3,2,1].

* Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively? *

## Solution

### Recursive
Simple

### Iteratively
Use a stack, but also need a flag for each node to mark whether the children of the node have been push in the stack or not.
 * If yes, pop the node;
 * If no, push the children.
