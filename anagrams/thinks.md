Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams.

Note: All inputs will be in lower-case.

class Solution {
    public:
            vector<string> anagrams(vector<string> &strs) {
                        
                    }
};


use the map to organize string with the same length
use a 26-length arrays to judge whether is anagram, time is O(N)
use sort and compare to judge, time is O(N)+O(NlgN)
